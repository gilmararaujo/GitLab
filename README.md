gitlab-installer
================

Easy Gitlab installer, targeting Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, on Vagrant or on metal.

Supported Vagrant providers:
 * Virtualbox
 * Parallels
 * LXC

Untested Vagrant providers (worked with 14.04 LTS):
 * VMWare

Requires Vagrant >= 1.8.0.

Usage
=====

Copy `gitlab.rb.example` to `gitlab.rb` and modify it with your preferences.
For complete template, please see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/files/gitlab-config-template/gitlab.rb.template

In VM, Gitlab is available at https://127.0.0.1:8443/
In server install, Gitlab is available at https://127.0.0.1/

CI is integrated into Gitlab from version 8.0 onwards.


Configuration
=============

You can configure the VM running Gitlab by exporting environment variables on host side before issuing `vagrant up`:
 * `GITLAB_CPUS` = how many CPUs will be given to the VM (default `2`)
 * `GITLAB_MEMORY` = how much memory (in MB) will be used (default `2048`)
 * `GITLAB_PORT` = which port on the host Gitlab responds to (default `8443`)
 * `GITLAB_SWAP` = if you want a swap file within VM (low memory host), in G (default `0`)
 * `GITLAB_HOST` = set hostname (default is `gitlab.local`)

Example:
```
 $ export GITLAB_MEMORY=4096
 $Â vagrant up
```


Releases
========

Check tags for releases matching GitLab releases.

From Gitlab version 7.1.1 onwards, it utilizes the omnibus package instead of executing
long setup scripts. If you wish to use setup scripts or Puppet/Chef, there are plenty of
other choises.

From Gitlab version 7.11.2 onwards, it uses packageserver with apt. Which means there is
little reason to change the installer anymore.

From Gitlab version 8.13.2 onwards, default OS is Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial, Ubuntu's next LTS release.
Old 14.04 LTS installer (which is compatible with Gitlab still, just Vagrant base boxes differ)
is found at `ubuntu-14.04` branch.


Gitlab CI integration
=====================

Gitlab CI and Gitlab CI Runner scripts were split into separate repository. You can find them at:
https://github.com/tuminoid/gitlabci-installer

From 7.5.1 onwards, CI is also enabled in this repository as it is bundled with Gitlab.
To disable CI, comment out `ci_external_url` line in script.

From 8 onwards, CI is part of Gitlab. You need to comment out following lines in `gitlab.rb`
(if you reuse your old `gitlab.rb`):
```
# ci_external_url 'http://gitlabci.local/'
# nginx['redirect_http_to_https'] = false
```
